# Obsidian Notes dater 

An [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin that adds the date that the active Obsidian file was created on and last updated on to the status bar of Obsidian (bottom of the screen). 

It works for all files including notes, images, and PDFs. 

Because this app uses the status bar it is not supported in the mobile app. 

If you have any feedback or feature requests please open an issue or email me to let me know.
